		<h1>ABOUT ME</h1><br />
		<p>
			I'm a bay area native. I grew up in Fremont, California with my parents and one younger brother. I played one year of high school football as a defensive lineman for the Mission San Jose  Warriors, but spent more time playing saxophone in the jazz band and teaching myself to play guitar. 
		</p>
		<p>
			After high school, I spent a stint in the army as a mechanic ("Wheeled Vehicle Repairer" in Army jargon) before returning to Northern California to get my bachelor's of Public Relations from San Jose State University.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my spare time, I'm a long-suffering fan of the A's, Raiders and Sharks. I also enjoy science fiction novels, superhero movies and 90's alt rock. I'm a mostly off-again runner and a mostly on-again overindulger of coffee and super burritos.
		</p>
		<p>
			Today I live in San Jose, California with two cute but annoying cats and Randi, my beautiful wife and constant source of inspiration.
