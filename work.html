		<h1>MY WORK</h1><br />
		<h2>Product Manager at Mixbook</h2>
		<p>June 2012 - Present</p>
		<p>
			Mixbook is a rapidly growing Silicon Valley startup that has built the world’s best experiences for making photo books: <a href="http://www.mixbook.com" target="_blank">Mixbook</a>, <a href="http://www.montagebook.com" target="_blank">Montage</a> and <a href="http://heymosaic.com" target="_blank">Mosaic</a>. After more than a year at Mixbook taking on a progressively larger role in the company, it made sense for me to move into a role as the only PM, leading a series of purpose-built teams. Since then, I've been enthusiastically helping our amazing designers, engineers, and other teammates launch and improve products at Mixbook to achieve our vision of helping the world to relive and share life’s most important memories.

		<h4>Mosaic</h4>
		<p>
			In 2013 and 2014 I led product development on the Mosaic Photo Books app in a series of initiatives including launching on two new platforms (Android and iPad) and 7 new countries, ultimately growing revenue by 53% year-over-year.
		</p>
		<h4>Mixbook.com</h4>
		<p>
			In 2012 and 2013 I led several teams focused on Mixbook.com, including Cards &amp; New Product, Growth, and the Launch Team. My proudest accomplishments include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Launching a rebrand of the company, including a redesign of Mixbook.com
			</li>
			<li>
				Launching multiple new products on Mixbook.com, including lay-flat books, dust jackets, and address labels
			</li>
			<li>
				Leading a Growth team that resulted in over $800k in incremental revenue during Q4 2012
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In 2015 I returned to lead product on Mixbook.com as part of the company’s strategic focus on our core web experience.
